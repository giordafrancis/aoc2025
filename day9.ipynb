Coordinate compression is something that interests me, and it was used as this hint. A bit like vocabulary token-to-ID and ID-to-token mapping. I think we could use something like this here.\n",

But not sure if it would make a difference here. more on this later\n",

The parallel to encoding and decoding tokens to vocab and vice versa was easy for me to understand.\n",
