You jump in.</p>\n",

       "<p>There are a few Elves here frantically decorating before the deadline. They think they'll be able to finish most of the work, but the one thing they're worried about is the <em>presents</em> for all the young Elves that live here at the North Pole. It's an ancient tradition to put the presents under the trees, but the Elves are worried they won't <em>fit</em>.</p>\n",
       "<p>The presents come in a few standard but very weird shapes. The shapes and the regions into which they need to fit are all measured in standard <em>units</em>. To be aesthetically pleasing, the presents need to be placed into the regions in a way that follows a standardized two-dimensional unit grid; you also can't stack presents.</p>\n",
       "<p>As always, the Elves have a summary of the situation (your puzzle input) for you. First, it contains a list of the presents' shapes. Second, it contains the size of the region under each tree and a list of the number of presents of each shape that need to fit into that region. For example:</p>\n",

The rest of the line describes the presents that need to fit into that region by listing the <em>quantity of each shape</em> of present; <code>1 0 1 0 3 2</code> means you need to fit one present with shape index 0, no presents with shape index 1, one present with shape index 2, no presents with shape index 3, three presents with shape index 4, and two presents with shape index 5.</p>\n",
       "<p>Presents can be <em>rotated and flipped</em> as necessary to make them fit in the available space, but they have to always be placed perfectly on the grid. Shapes can't overlap (that is, the <code>#</code> part from two different presents can't go in the same place on the grid), but they <em>can</em> fit together (that is, the <code>.</code> part in a present's shape's diagram does not block another present from occupying that space on the grid).</p>\n",
       "<p>The Elves need to know <em>how many of the regions</em> can fit the presents listed. In the above example, there are six unique present shapes and three regions that need checking.</p>\n",

       "<pre><code>AAA.\n",
       "ABAB\n",
       "ABAB\n",
       ".BBB\n",
       "</code></pre>\n",
       "<p>The second region, <code>12x5: 1 0 1 0 2 2</code>, is <code>12</code> units wide and <code>5</code> units long. In that region, you need to try to fit one present with shape index <code>0</code>, one present with shape index <code>2</code>, two presents with shape index <code>4</code>, and two presents with shape index <code>5</code>.</p>\n",
       "<p>It turns out that these presents <em>can</em> all fit in this region. Here is one way to do it, again using different capital letters to represent all the required presents:</p>\n",

       "<p>The third region, <code>12x5: 1 0 1 0 3 2</code>, is the same size as the previous region; the only difference is that this region needs to fit one additional present with shape index <code>4</code>. Unfortunately, no matter how hard you try, there is <em>no way to fit all of the presents</em> into this region.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, in this example, <code><em>2</em></code> regions can fit all of their listed presents.</p>\n",

    "- Each shape fits in a 3×3 bounding box = 9 cells max\n",
    "- If `(num_shapes × 9) / area` > some threshold, shapes **cannot** fit\n",

    "\n",
    "From your example data:\n",
    "- 2 regions have cf < ~1.1 → these are the 2 that **can** fit (matches expected answer!)\n",
    "- 1 region has higher cf → **cannot** fit\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def quick_reject(w, h, counts):\n",
    "    area = w * h\n",
    "    cf = sum(counts) * 9 / area\n",
    "    return cf > 1.1  # definitely can't fit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then only run the expensive `solve()` on regions that pass this check. Try it on the real puzzle input—how does the histogram look? How many regions can you immediately reject?"

    "\n",
    "**What you nailed:**\n",
    "- The immutable recursion insight (`to_place[1:]`) is exactly the key takeaway—you articulated it well. Each call gets its own snapshot, making backtracking \"free\"\n",
    "- Acknowledging the data visualization lesson is huge. The compression factor heuristic turned an exponential problem into a one-liner\n",
    "\n",
    "**One addition to consider:**\n",
    "Earlier you said you wanted me to flag this: your journey through the `first_empty` bug was valuable learning too. You initially assumed every cell must be filled, then discovered the grid can have gaps. That debugging process—forming a hypothesis, testing it, revising—is core problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:**\n",
    "You went from \"I don't understand backtracking\" to implementing it correctly and understanding *why* it works. That's real learning. And the humility to look at someone else's tip and recognize when brute-force won't scale is a skill many people lack.\n",
