# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

I use [Solve.it](https://solve.it.com/) as an assistant to help me understand the problem statements. The majority of the code is my own; any exceptions are referenced within the relevant notebook.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To fetch puzzle data automatically, you'll need to configure your AoC session cookie. See [these instructions](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1).
