The problem is to find a path, so this smells like traversing a graph-like structure from root to last node. Part one is staying focused on only one path. This is not a tree structure because each node can have more than one parent. A condition for a tree? Please review.\n",

    "Good analysis! You're right on several points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph, not a tree** — Correct! A tree requires each node to have *exactly one parent* (except the root, which has none). Here, nodes like `ddd` have multiple parents (`bbb` and `ccc` both lead to it), so it's a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding all paths** — Small clarification: Part 1 asks for the *count of all paths* from `you` to `out`, not just one path. In the example, there are 5 different paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DAG structure** — The data flows in one direction (no cycles), which makes this a DAG. This is important because it means you won't get stuck in infinite loops when traversing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data structure, you could represent this as a dictionary mapping each node to its list of outputs (children). Something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'you': ['bbb', 'ccc'], 'bbb': ['ddd', 'eee'], ...}\n",

    "Great instincts! Both are relevant here:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DFS (Depth-First Search)** — The natural approach. From `you`, recursively explore each child, and from each child explore *their* children, until you hit `out`. Each time you reach `out`, that's one complete path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caching/Memoization** — Here's the key insight: if you've already computed \"how many paths from node X to `out`\", you don't need to recompute it when you arrive at X from a different parent. For example, both `bbb` and `ccc` lead to `ddd` — you only need to count paths from `ddd` once.\n",

    "OK, my instinct was to use a dict. My guess is I'm falling into the issue regarding mutability you have mentioned. During recursion calls on a new branch, visited required is persisting and never flushes out. A frozen set would flush out. This part is not 100% clear yet to me. I assume not adding the node (can't as it's immutable) but creating a new variable with union would cover the frozen set persistence in the recursive call. \n",

    "\n",
    "**On Part 1**: You've got a solid grasp now. The \"bubbling up\" of return values in recursion is indeed the key insight — each `return 1` at a leaf propagates up and sums at branch points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Part 2**: You nailed the core lesson — mutable state shared across branches causes contamination. The frozenset (or creating new objects with `|`) ensures each branch has independent state. This is a common pitfall in recursive backtracking problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance/Cleanliness ideas**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sum with generator** — Instead of the `total = 0; for...; total +=` pattern:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return sum(find2_cached(child, vr) for child in xs[node])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Early exit** — Once you've seen both `dac` and `fft`, you could potentially switch to a simpler/faster count (no need to track anymore). Though with caching, the benefit may be marginal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`cache` decorator** — Python 3.9+ has `@cache` which is shorthand for `@lru_cache(maxsize=None)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution is already quite clean and efficient. The caching reduced what could be exponential to linear in unique `(node, state)` pairs.\n",
